* Bimodal Noise Sparse Variational Gaussian Process

This repo contains the majority of my PhD work to date.

** Dir Structure
1. The BMNSVGP directory contains the majority of the work
   - It contains the model, likelihood and script for training it (trainer.py).
2. The data directory contains all of the data collected from flying a DJI Tello quadcopter in turbulent flows in the Bristol Robotics Laboratory.
3. The notebooks directory contains old notebooks with the model in its old state.
